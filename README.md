# A Plus Plus Programming Language

My parents are Asian so they would not accept me learning to program in C or C++. I created this programming language called A++ in an attempt to have my parents approval.

Jokes asides, I want to learn more about how an interpreter works, so I want to learn how it works by working on this project. It will be written in Golang and based on the instructions by Thorsten Ball.
